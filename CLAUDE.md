# Voxel-Sampo Project Analysis

> **Note**: This document is continuously updated to reflect the current state of the project and recent changes.

## Project Overview

**Voxel-Sampo** is a sophisticated 3D voxel-based scene viewer built with the Bevy game engine. The project implements a complete interactive 3D environment featuring physics-based player movement, advanced camera controls, and high-quality voxel model rendering from MagicaVoxel (.vox) files.

## Architecture & Technologies

### Core Technology Stack
- **Bevy 0.16.0**: Modern ECS-based game engine with dynamic linking
- **bevy_vox_scene 0.19.0**: MagicaVoxel file loading and rendering
- **bevy_rapier3d 0.30.0**: Physics simulation with collision detection

### ECS Architecture Patterns
The project exemplifies modern Entity-Component-System design:
- **Pure Components**: Data-only components with no embedded logic
- **Focused Systems**: Single-responsibility systems with clear dependencies
- **Resource Management**: Centralized configuration and state via Bevy resources

## Key Systems Implementation

### Physics System (Rapier3D Integration)
- **Player Physics**: Dynamic rigid body with realistic movement properties
  - High friction (1.5) and damping (8.0) for responsive arcade-style controls
  - Force-based movement rather than direct velocity manipulation
- **World Collision**: TriMesh colliders for complex voxel geometry
- **Collision Detection**: Full physics integration with voxel environments

### Advanced Camera System
Multi-component camera architecture:
- **CameraAngle**: Manages viewing angles and directional calculations
- **CameraRotationController**: Implements smooth rotation with momentum
- **CameraZoomController**: Dynamic zoom based on rotation velocity
- **Snap-to-Angle System**: Precise positioning at predefined angles (60°, 150°, 240°, 330°)

### Player Movement Mechanics
- **Camera-Relative Controls**: Movement adapts to current camera orientation
- **Discrete Movement**: Forces cardinal direction movement only
- **Velocity Limiting**: Caps horizontal speed while preserving vertical physics
- **External Forces**: Uses physics forces for natural movement feel

### Rendering Pipeline
- **HDR Rendering**: High dynamic range for superior lighting
- **Environment Mapping**: Realistic reflections using HDR environment maps
- **Post-Processing**: Bloom effects and tone mapping
- **Orthographic Projection**: Maintains consistent voxel aesthetic
